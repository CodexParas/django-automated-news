Despite scoring just one century (131) and two fifties from eight matches, Rohit's dynamic starts have significantly benefited the Indian team.During the recent match against South Africa, Rohit Sharma's quickfire 40 off 24 balls set the tone for India.The team scored an imposing 326 for 5 after opting to bat first, and South Africa was dismissed for a mere 83, resulting in a massive 243-run win.Rathour attributed this attacking approach to Rohit himself, stating, \"It's absolutely Rohit's idea. He's taking the initiative. If there's something on the wicket, he's looking to go for his shots. It is working out really well for the team. He's one guy who's leading with his action.\"In the same match, Rohit Sharma, along with Shubman Gill, took charge against South Africa's new-ball bowlers Lungi Ngidi and Marco Jansen, disrupting their rhythm and allowing India to reach 91 for 1 in the powerplay. This opening stand eased the pressure on Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer in the middle overs, enabling them to accelerate the run-rate.Rathour appreciated this strategic move, saying, \"We're looking to score as many runs as we can.
